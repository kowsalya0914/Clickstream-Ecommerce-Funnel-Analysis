# Clickstream-Ecommerce-Funnel-Analysis
A Power BI dashboard analyzing user clickstream data to understand drop-offs in the e-commerce conversion funnel.

Week 1: Data Understanding & Cleaning
1. Objective
Understand the clickstream dataset and prepare it for funnel analysis by cleaning, fixing inconsistencies, and preparing usable fields for Power BI.

2. Tasks Completed
Imported raw clickstream dataset (sessions.csv, products.csv, reviews.csv, orders.csv)
Performed detailed data cleaning, including:
Removal of duplicates
Handling missing values
Standardizing date & time formats
Cleaning text fields (lowercasing, trimming, removing special characters)
Correcting outliers and invalid values
Fixing inconsistent product names
Unifying session identifiers
Merged all datasets into a structured format suitable for funnel modeling.

3. Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Power BI

Excel / CSV data exploration

4. Key Learnings
How clickstream events behave in real e-commerce flows
How session-level data requires careful cleaning
Importance of consistent identifiers across datasets
Converting raw data into funnel stages

5. Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)
